    "## The Multi-armed bandit problem\n",
    "Imagine you're faced with a number of slot machines (also called 'bandits'), each with a lever ('arm') to pull. Upon pulling a particular lever, it will give a random reward from an unknown distribution particular to that lever. The goal of the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, is to maximise your total reward given that you are allowed to pull levers a fixed number of times total (this is called your 'budget').\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic strategy might be to spend some of your budget pulling different levers to get an idea of which levers give the most reward ('exploration'). After this, you may choose increasingly often pull the lever that you expect gives the most reward ('exploitation'). The question then is: how much exploration and how much exploitation makes the optimal strategy? This 'exploration-exploitation trade-off' is a classic feature of reinforcement learning problems: we have to interact with the environment to gather data, and we must choose an optimal way of interacting on the fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a MAB environment to interact with. Spend some time pulling levers to get a feeling for the problem (see cells below)."

In order to do this, you're tasked with writing a strategy (policy) that maximises the expected reward, or - equivalently - mimises the expected regret (where the expectation is taken over multiple simulations where a new MAB is instantiated each time). Regret of a policy is defined here as: expected optimal reward - expected obtained reward.
